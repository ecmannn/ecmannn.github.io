I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science and the School of Global Policy and Strategy at UC San Diego.

My research interests lie at the intersection of International Relations and Comparative Politics, with a focus on the international determinants of democratic backsliding and the relationship between trade and security.
